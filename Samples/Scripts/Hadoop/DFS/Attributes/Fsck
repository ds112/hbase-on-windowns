REM HDFS supports the fsck command to check for various inconsistencies. 
REM It it is designed for reporting problems with various files, for example, missing blocks for a file or under-replicated blocks. 
REM Unlike a traditional fsck utility for native file systems, this command does not correct the errors it detects. 
REM Normally NameNode automatically corrects most of the recoverable failures. 
REM By default fsck ignores open files but provides an option to select all files during reporting. 
REM The HDFS fsck command is not a Hadoop shell command. It can be run as bin/hdfs fsck. 
REM Usage: hdfs fsck <path>
REM          [-list-corruptfileblocks |
REM          [-move | -delete | -openforwrite]
REM          [-files [-blocks [-locations | -racks]]]
