REM Receives text from multiple rawNetworkStreams and counts how many '\n' delimited
REM lines have the word 'the' in them. This is useful for benchmarking purposes. This
REM will only work with spark.streaming.util.RawTextSender running on all worker nodes
REM and with Spark using Kryo serialization (set Java property "spark.serializer" to
REM "org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer").
REM SYNCBDP_HOME=<INSTALL-DRIVE>\Syncfusion\BigData\<version>\BigDataSDK
REM Sample source code is available at %SYNCBDP_HOME%\SDK\Spark\examples\src\main\scala\org\apache\spark\examples\Streaming\RawNetworkGrep
REM Specify active name node hostname/IP address in place of <hostname> in below line to access data from the cluster.
REM Usage: RawNetworkGrep <numStreams> <hostname> <port> <batchMillis>
REM <numStream> is the number rawNetworkStreams, which should be same as number of work nodes in the cluster
REM <port> is the port on which RawTextSender is running in the worker nodes.
REM <batchMillise> is the Spark Streaming batch duration in milliseconds.
